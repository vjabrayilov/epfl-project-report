Distributed systems present new and difficult to study failure modes.

Symbolically executing distrubuted systems is hard.

In this paper we discuss an idea on how to reason about distributed systems using symbolic
execution along with a prelimiary evaluation of how this approach can be employed to detect
metastable failures.

% We present an approach to symbex distributed systems to detect presence of metastability.
