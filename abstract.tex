Metastable failures are an outlier class of failures within distributed systems that are much easier to explain than to predict. Prior works \cite{mtsb_hotos, mtsb_osdi} show that they can be understood within the same framework even though they initially look different. A systematic approach for building metastable failure tolerant distributed systems  as well as detecting them before happening is an open problem that this paper takes attempt to solve. 

First, we show why formal specification doesn't work well enough by applying it to a synthetic benchmark problem. Later we introduce how SMT($\mathcal{LRA}$) constraints of the system can help to detect metastable failures before they happen. We also introduce a way to learn SMT($\mathcal{LRA}$) constraints of the system using run time metrics which are regularly collected for observability. purposes.
